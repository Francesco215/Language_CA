        One of the most striking example of Self-organization is the formation of multicellular organisms, where each cell can only interact with its local environment through its cell membrane, but based on the signals it receives from its neighbors and its own internal state, it is able to understand what type of cell it should be and self-regulate. Despite the limited information available to each individual cell, incredibly complex organisms can be formed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this work we show how the same process of self-organization that occurs in biological systems can be used to create cohesive narrative skills in linguistic space, where the words in a text self-organize to create a coherent whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what makes a system capable of self-organizing in the first place? In this paper we show that the ability of a system to self-organize relies on having the right topology for cell communication. Furthermore, using tools from Statistical Physics, we show that current state of the art architectures for text generation lack the appropriate topology to be able to generate arbitrarily long, coherent text.

        One of the things that makes phase transitions beautiful is their universality. Despite the vast variety and complexity of systems of many particles, there are just a few of different phases of aggregation, and phase transitions are described by just a handful of critical exponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, we observe that many systems tend to attain an ordered state at low temperatures. For instance, in Ising models, the ferromagnetic phase emerges with aligned spins, while materials exhibit a solid phase with a crystalline structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper we are going to show that asking if it is possible to generate arbitrarily long, coherent text is equivalent to asking if the system is capable of having an ordered phase.

      The complexity of generating a text with $N$ words with modern machine learning algorithms such as the Transformer is $O(N^2)$. This makes it computationally infeasible to generate coherent pieces of text as long as books. Self-organizing systems, on the other hand, have two big strenghts that transformers lack
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Efficency: Self-organizing systems often exhibit efficient resource allocation and optimization of processes. The emergent patterns and structures that arise from local interactions can lead to efficient distribution of tasks, information, or resources, resulting in overall system efficiency
          </li>
          <li>
            Scalability: Self-organizing systems can often scale effectively. As the number of components increases the system can still organize itself without requiring additional centralized control. This property is valuable in various domains, such as computer networks, where scalability is crucial
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Inspired from Biology and using tools from Statistical Physics we show that:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Autoregressive models, no matter the architecture, the number of parameters, the window size, and the training procedure will never be able to generate text that is coherent at arbitrarily long distances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transformers with attention matrices with a specifically crafted topology, can in principle be able to generate text that is coherent at arbitrarily long distances.
          </li>
          <li>
            An agent with a finite context size can be capable of enacting long term plans if it is able to interact with an external envoirnment by deliberatly storing and retreiving information.

        This paper aims to showcase how the process of self-organization, observed in biological systems, can be harnessed to develop coherent narrative skills within linguistic space. By allowing words in a text to self-organize, a cohesive and meaningful whole can be created.
      </p>
      <p>
        In textual context, words organize themselves into sentences, which further organize into chapters, ultimately forming complete books. Similarly, in biological organisms, cells organize into specific structures, which then combine to form organs, culminating in fully grown organisms

      <p>
        However, we demonstrate that attempting to teach a machine learning algorithm to generate text by simply providing each word with information solely from its neighboring words is unsuccessful in achieving self-organization.<br> This is due to the fact that text, is a 1-dimentional sequence of words, and self organization in 1D is impossible. Biological organisms, are 3-dimentional so don't have this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also show that, in principle, it is possible to generate long-coherent text by changing how the elements of a sequence interact with one another
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why focus on text to study self-organization?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Long-range cohesion is a necessary feature of text, and it is something that current language processing algorithms don’t possess. This will mean that any improvement on the theoretical front, will directly translate into an application in the field of natural language processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            In text, spotting a misspelled word is easy. In biological (and virtual) organisms spotting an off place cell is hard.<br>
            This raises the bar of difficulty so it will give a more rigorous test on the ability of self-organizing systems
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s easier to run experiments on code rather than biological organisms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since text is a 1-dimentional sequence it can give insights into other types of 1D sequences, for example a sequence of actions performed by an agent.<br>
            Having long term coherence for a sequence of actions performed by an agent means that the agent is able to stick to a plan and use information from the distant past to make decisions on what to do next.

    <d-section id="intro">The simplest example of self-organization: The Ising Model</d-section>
    <p>
      Initially, when I delved into the study of the Ising model, I found it utterly useless and couldn't comprehend why physicists were so fixated on this seemingly mundane model. Consequently, I mustered the bare minimum effort required to pass my exams, and as expected, my brain discarded the information it deemed irrelevant, causing me to completely forget about it.<br><br>

      Upon graduating I had an abundance of time on my hands. Curiously, I found myself engrossed in studying more than I ever did during my university days. A few months prior to graduating, I had even published a piece on self-organization in Cellular Automata<d-cite key="cavuoti2022adversarial"></d-cite>. However, the results didn't seem general enought for me<d-footnote>Most of the results in Machine learning are like this, you find an algorithm that works, and then you say something handwavy that tries to explain wat is going on</d-footnote> and, therefore, turned back to the realm of statistical physics in search of answers.
      <blockquote>
        I now understood that in order to understand Self-Organizing systems in general, I had to understand the simplest of them all: The Ising model.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      But what exactly is the Ising model? Originally conceived as a simple explanation for magnetization effects in matter, the Ising model explores the interplay between interacting spins. These spins, when in proximity, have a preference to align with each other, leading to an interaction energy denoted by $H=-Js_1\cdot s_2$.<br><br>

      But what happens when lots of spins interact? Whell, it depends on how they interact: The Ising Model comes in many different flavors, we are going to look at the 3 simplest ones: the fully connected, the 1D and the 2D one.
    </p>

    <d-subsection>Fully connected Ising model</d-subsection>
    <p>
      In the fully connected Ising model we have L spins, all interacting with each other. The Hamiltonian of the system is 

      $$H=-\frac JN\sum_{i\neq j}s_is_j$$

      Now lets see how the system behaves as a function of the temperature.

    <p>
      As you can see, below a certain <i>Critical Temperature</i> $T_\textrm c$ you have an <i>Ordered Phase</i>, while above you have a <i>Disordered Phase</i>
    </p>

    <d-subsection>1D Ising Model</d-subsection>
      <p>
      In the 1D Ising Model, spins are arranged in a chain and interact with their neighboring spins. The system's Hamiltonian can be expressed as:
      $$
      H=-J\sum_{i}s_is_{i+1}
      $$
      Now, let's examine the behavior of this system in relation to temperature.
      </p>

      <p>
      As observed, regardless of how low the temperature is, the system never manages to achieve an ordered phase. This can be proven mathematically with the following theorem
      </p>
      <b class="theorem">Theorem</b>

          At thermal equilibrium, the Free Energy $F$ is minimized.<d-footnote>This is because the Free Energy measures the amount of useful energy that can be extracted from a thermodynamic system. At thermal equilibrium, no useful energy can be extracted.</d-footnote></p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate that the ordered state, where all spins align, is not the minimum of Free Energy, we have to examine what occurs when a domain wall forms.
        </p>

            The top image shows the ordered phase of the Ising model, while the bottom image depicts a state with a domain wall.

        </figure>
        <p>
          Upon the formation of a domain wall, the energy change increases by $2J$. This is because only a single link now comprises two opposite spins.<br><br>
          If the chain is $L$ spins long, there can be $L-1$ possible locations for the domain wall. Consequently, the size of the configuration space where a domain wall is present, denoted as $\Omega$, equals $\Omega = L-1$. Since entropy is the logarithm of the configuration space, we have $\Delta S = \log(L-1)$.<br><br>
          Therefore, the change in Free Energy upon the formation of a domain wall is given by:
          $$
          \Delta F= \Delta E -T\Delta S= J - T\log(L-1)
          $$
          In the thermodynamic limit, as $L$ approaches infinity, and since $J$ is a constant, we find that for any temperature $T$, $\Delta F < 0$.<br><br>
          Thus no matter how low the temperature (or the noise) is, it is impossible to reach an ordered state

    <d-subsection>2D Ising model</d-subsection>
    <p>
      In the 2D Ising model the spins are arranged in a grid, and each one of them interacts with his neighbours. The system's Hamiltonian can be expressed as
      $$
        H=-J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} s_is_j
      $$
      Where $\langle i, j\rangle$ means that we sum over all the neighboring spins. And let's see how it behaves

          <p>The following proof is also known as <i>Peierls Argument</i> <d-cite key="bonati2014peierls, peierls1936ising"></d-cite>.</p>
          <p>
            Suppose we start in a configuration where all the spins are all in the $+1$ configuration, we now create a domain with a perimeter $\mathcal P$ made of spins in the $-1$ configuration, and see what happens to the Free Energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The change in energy will be $$\Delta E= 2J\times \mathcal P$$ 
            Where $J$ is the coupling strenght between spins
          </p>
          <p>
            The change in Entropy is harder to estimate, fortunately we only need an upper bound.<br>
            We need to find the number of domain with a perimeter $\mathcal P$.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can always fit a curve of perimeter $\mathcal P$ inside a box $\mathcal P\times \mathcal P$ centered in the origin, so the number of starting points is at most $\mathcal P^2$, then at each step along the perimeter the curve has at most 3 choices for where to step next, so for each starting point there are at most $3^{\mathcal P}$ curves <d-footnote>The choices are usually less than 3 beacuse the curve is a close self-avoiding curve, so to satisfy this constraints usually has less choices. It can be proven that there are at least $2^{\mathcal P/2}$ possible configurations FIND THE SOURCE</d-footnote>
          </p>
          <p>
            We can thus conclude that the number of possible configuration $\Omega\le \mathcal P^23^\mathcal P$, and the change in entropy is
            $$
              \Delta S\le \mathcal P\log3 +2\log\mathcal P
            $$
            Putting it all toghether we have that
            $$\Delta F \ge 2J\mathcal P - T \mathcal P\log3 +O(\log \mathcal P)$$
            And if $T$ is sufficently low we have that $\Delta F>0$, thus for low temperature the 2D Ising model at the equilibrium tends to an ordered phase.

      <summary><b>Ising model on a Tree</b></summary>
      <p>
        Many self-organizing systems seem to gravitate towards a hierarchical structure, in earlier sections of the paper we talked about how cells and words on the text organize into bigger and bigger structures. The same goes for how peaple organize into teams, companies, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, let's take a breaf look at the Ising model on a Tree<d-cite key="breuckmann2020critical"></d-cite>. <br>
        Interestingly, the Ising model on a tree can be thought as a 2D Ising model in hyperbolic geometry, this means that the same proof for the existence of an ordered phase is pretty much the same as the one in the 2D case, but with the extra flavour of hyperbolic geometry.

        As a last example we will consider a slightly modified 1D Ising chain. In this example there is an extra spin particle $e=\pm 1$ linked to all the other spins
        $$
          H=-J\sum_{i}(s_is_{i+1} +es_i)

      With this simple extra modification the system is capable or reaching an ordered phase. The proof is left as an excercise for the reader.

    <d-subsection>Main takeaway from the Ising model</d-subsection>
    <p>
      We have seen that the ability of a self-organizing system to reach an ordered state can indeed be understood through the lens of phase transitions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to self-organizing systems, the concept of an ordered state typically refers to a highly organized and coherent configuration. For example, in the Ising model, an ordered state corresponds to spins aligning in a particular direction. In other self-organizing systems, it may involve patterns, structures, or coordinated behaviors emerging among the individual elements of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding the behavior of self-organizing systems in terms of phase transitions allows us to analyze their equilibrium properties, and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the emergence of order. By studying the conditions and factors that influence phase transitions in self-organizing systems, we can better comprehend their ability to reach ordered states.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now give an overview of a more complicated self-organizing system though the lens of phase-transition: The Hopfield Network

    <d-section>Associative Memory</d-section>
    <p>
      The brain is capable of storing and retreiving memories, but the way it does that is very different on how the memories are managed in a computer.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Address based memories</b>, which are the kind of memories stored in a computer, work that given a memory address, it gives you back the information stored in that specific address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Associative memories</b> are how memories are stored and extracted in human brains. In an associative memory system, a memory becomes easier to extract the more “hints” or related memories are given.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p><p>
      So basically, in an associative memory, when you give him a prompt, it gives you the most associated memory stored to the prompt given<d-footnote>You might already suspect where this is going, but for now we will stay away from Natural Language Processing</d-footnote><d-footnote>One such example in computer science is what happens when you Google something, it gives you a list of related links stored somewhere on the internet.</d-footnote>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, a associative memory can be modeled as a energy landscape with with a discrete number of minima, each of which corresponding to a stored memory
      <d-figure>
        <img src="website/images/associative_memory-1.png" width="100%">

    </p>
    <p>
      Associative memories, just like the merory inside a computer have finite capacity, but how do you quintify this?<br>
      Intuitively what ends up happening when you try to store too many separate memories, is that the configuration space becomes too crammed and some of the saved patterns fuse toghered.

    <d-subsection>Hopfield Networks</d-subsection>
    <p>
      Hopfield Networks <d-cite key="hopfield1982neural"></d-cite> are one of the most famous examples of associative memories, and, it turns out that, when generalized, they are equivalent to the Transformer architecture <d-cite key="ramsauer2020hopfield"></d-cite>. It is the perfect working bench to understand what are the capabilities of associative memeories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard Hopfield Network with $N$ patterns stored equation is the following
      $$
        H=\sum_{ij}W_{ij}s_is_j\quad\textrm{ with }\quad W_{ij}=\sum_p^NX^p_{i}X^p_{j}
      $$
      Notice how this is similar to the equation of the Hamiltonian of the fully connected Ising model <d-footnote>...Actually if there is just one stored pattern they are equivalent up to a Gauge transformation $s_i\to X_is_i$</d-footnote>. What effectively does is that it creates a number of local minima equal to the number of patterns stored, here is a simulation.

          You can go from a saved pattern to the other by increasing the temperature and relowering (it works 50% of the times). If you dont want to wait for the system to thermalize you can just reload the page.

      As you can see at low temperature the system converges to the closest state, but at hight temperature the system is noisy.

  <d-subsection>Hopfield networks with local interaction</d-subsection>
    <p>
      Many of the self-organizing systems in real life are capable to reach an highly ordered state even with just local interactions, so what happens if the Hamiltonian of the Hopfield network makes spins interact only if they are close by?
      $$
        H=\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}W_{ij}s_is_j\quad\textrm{ with }\quad W_{ij}=\sum_p^NX^p_{i}X^p_{j}
      $$
      In this case $\langle i,j\rangle$ means that $i$ and $j$ are in the same window of interaction. Here is a simutation to play with.

    <p>
      As you can see the system strugles more to converge to one of the saved patters, and the smaller the window size is, the harder it becomes.<br> What it is possible to conclude even with this small demo is that the memory capacity of a local Hopfield Model is lower, we will later analize by how much.

          Side by side comparison between text generation and morphogenesis
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Many phenomena in self-organizing systems are interpreted in the literature as navigation in a morphologiacal space
        <d-cite key="fields2022competency"></d-cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In various fields like biology, linguistics, computer science, and design, a morphological space refers to a conceptual space where each point represents a specific configuration or form of an entity. The term "morphological" refers to the form, structure, or shape of something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Navigating a morphological space involves exploring and moving through this conceptual space to observe or analyze the different configurations or forms that an entity can take. It is often used to understand the relationships between different variations or possibilities within a system. Better configurations are associated to a lower energy value, and the system evolves rolling down this energy landscape
      </p>
      <p>
        One common example is in biology, where the concept of morphological space can be used to describe the range of physical forms that a species can exhibit. By navigating this space, the organism changes shape over time. Both processes of morphogenesis and damage repair can be thought as navigating this morphological space towards the stable adult form of the organism. The damage becomes impossible to heal for the organism if it puts it in a point into the morphological space outside the bacin of attraction of the stable configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing parallels between text generation and morphogenesis, text generation starts with a prompt (analogous to an embryo) and progresses, generating the rest of the text until completion. Similarly, correcting errors in text, such as misspelled or missing words, bears similarity to the process of repairing damage in biological organisms. Both tasks are error correction procedures that involve navigating a morphological space to rectify errors and achieve the desired final state.

  What makes a self-organizing system capable of organizing?
</d-section>
  <p>
    So far we have seen that
    <ul>
      <li>The 1D Ising model is not capable of self-organizing in to an ordered phase</li>
      <li>The 2D Ising model is capable of self-organizing in to an ordered phase, but it takes time</li>
      <li>The Fully connected Ising model is capable of self-organizing in to an ordered phase and it does that quickly</li>
      <li>The Standard Hopfield Network, which is a generalization of the Fully connected Ising model is capable of self-organizing quicky, but it doesn't have a large memory capacity</li>
      <li>Windowed Hopfield wich are a generalization of the 2D Ising model are in principle capable of self organizing, but their memory capacity is lower than the one of standard Hopfield Networks, and it takes time to self-organize</li>
    </ul>
    But is there a unified way of determining if any system is capable of self organizing?
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out that there is, but before proving in the general case, we will first prove why autoregressive models for text are incapable of generating text that remains coherent at arbitrary lenghts as it gives us the intuition to prove it in the more general case.<br>First, we generalize the value that the spins can take: instead of $-1$ and $1$, they can now take any integer value from $0$ to $V$<d-footnote>For now we are going to ignore the possibility of having continous valued elements</d-footnote>

      Ok, now we are going to define how this new spins interact with one onother. We want them to interact with only their neighbours, thus only interactions inside a finite Window are non zero.

    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see this is a very general structure that can be used to model cells, agents, particles, and words arranged in a line.<br><br>
      Ok, now what is a memory in this kind of situation? A pattern stored is a particular configutation of spins with zero energy, or more precisely:
    </p>
    <b class="Definition">Definition: Memory or Pattern stored</b>
    <p class="definition_text">
      A stored pattern $\mathcal P$ is a particular sequence of spins $(\dots, s_{-1}, s_0, s_1,\dots )$ such that the energy of the Hamiltonian $H$ associated to this pattern is equal to zero.

    <p>
      We will now make the parallelism explicit with Natural Language Processing. Most state of the art language models of today are Autoregressive, meaning to predict the next word (or token) they look at all the previous elements on the text.<br>
      However, as the context increases, it becames computationally infeasable to predict the next token, and only the last few words are fed as input to the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intuitively, this leads the model to completely forget what is left outside of its input window

      Notice how we don't really care what the spins represent: They can be the words in a text, or the state of the cells of an organism, or the actions performed by an agent, or the value of a title in the stock market.<br>
      We also don't really care how the probabilities are evaluated: The architecture of the model doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that how well you can predict the next element in a senquence can be considered a measure of intelligence. After all what any intelligent agent does is just finding the best next action.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how do we prove <i>mathematically</i> that autoregressive models with finite context are bound to lose the thread?
      <ul>
        <li>
          Firstly, we show that Autoregressive models, no matter the architecture, are equivalent to a thermodynamic system with a specifically crafted local Hamiltonian
        </li>
        <li>
          We then prove that local Hamiltonians in one dimentional systems are inherently incapable of reaching an ordered phase
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The significance of demonstrating the incapability of autoregressive models doesn't lie solely in the theorem itself. Intuitively, we already understand that autoregressive models, due to their inherent loss of information over time, are unable to generate lengthy texts. What holds importance is that through mathematical proof, we gain the knowledge necessary to establish the coherence of text generation through alternative methods.

              Through Botzmann's equation it's possible to turn a probability distribution to some energy levels

              We can now define a windowed Hamiltonian

              And the full local Hamiltoninan can now be seen as the sum of all the $H=\sum H_{i_\textrm{pred}}$ of the sequence.<br>
              The generation process of an autoregressive model can now be seen as sampling from the Boltzmann distribution given from 
              $$
                  p_\textrm{sequence}=\frac 1Z

              Suppose that our Potts chain starts out equal to our first stored pattern $\mathcal C=\mathcal P^1$. Now we want to know if the formation of a single domain barrier is thermodynamically favorable.

              $$
                  \Delta F=\Delta E -T\Delta S< 0
              $$
              For that to be true, the Free energy of the system must decrease upon the formation of a domain barrier.

              Upon the formation of a domain barrier, The windowed Hamiltonians that intersect it will have a non zero, positive energy. Therefore $\Delta E >0$, however, we know that the energy of each window Hamiltonian is smaller than $E^\textrm{max}$ and no more that $\mathcal W-1$ windows can be affected by a domain wall, therefore

              $$
                  0\le\Delta E\le (\mathcal W-1)E^\textrm{max}
              $$

              At the same time we know that in a sequence long $L$ there can be $L-1$ possible places where a domain wall can appear, and for each of this possible places it can lead to any of the $N-1$ other patterns saved, therefore there are $(L-1)(N-1)$ possible configurations where the system has a single domain wall. This means that the change of the entropy of the system is 

              $$
                  \Delta S=\log [(N-1)(L-1)] 
              $$

              Putting equations \ref{eq:de} and \ref{eq:s} all together we have that

              $$
                  \Delta F\le (\mathcal W-1)E^\textrm{max} - T\log [(N-1)(L-1)] 
              $$
              In the thermodynamic limit ($L\to \infty$) we have that the right hand side of the equation becomes eventually negative, therefore the domain barriers are inevitable.

      The most general way to consider the interaction between the elements of our system is if the interactions are represented by a graph Hamiltonian
    </p>
    <p>
      For simplicity we are going to consider that the links of the graph are fixed in time.<d-footnote>
      This is a simplification and loads of self-organizing systems have a interaction graph that changes with time, for example most of the people you interact daily are different from the people you interacted in your childhood.<br> Sometimes even the topology of the entire graph changes, for example before the invention of means of rapid comunication each person interacted only with the people nearby thus the topology was 2-dimentional. Today, with the internet we can interact with people far away.<br>
      However, we can say that even though the interaction graph changes with time, it usually changes slowly relative to the dynamics of the time evolution of its elements.

  <d-section>The role of Disorder</d-section>
    <div>
      <p>
        In all the theorems we saw, we assumed that the Free energy is minimized. This is true at thermal equilibrium, however for some systems the time it can take for a system to reach thermal equilibrium can be larger than the age of the universe. 
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        This usually happens when the energy landscape is rugged. Essentially the system stays trapped in a local minima before it ever get the chance to get to one of the global minima. In the rare occurrance that the system manages to escape the local minimum it will most likely go to another local minimum. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When a system is like this we say that it is a <i>spin-glass system</i>
        <d-footnote>
          A spin glass system is a type of physical system that exhibits what's called "quenched disorder." This disorder arises due to random couplings, denoted as $\theta$ among the different degrees of freedom within the system, which are represented by the variable $s$. The disorder is explicitly incorporated into the Hamiltonian of the system, and is completely specified by its probability distribution, $p(\theta) d\theta$.
          $$
            H=H(\theta,s)
          $$
          One of the most well-known examples of such a system is the Edwards-Anderson model <d-cite key="edwards1975theory"></d-cite>, which is a finite dimensional model where the spins, represented by $s$, are the degrees of freedom and the couplings, represented by $\theta_{ij}$, are Gaussian random variables.
          $$
            H=\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}J_{ij}s_is_j
          $$

          In this model, the sum is performed over nearest-neighbor spins. The disorder is said to be "quenched" because the $\theta$ values remain constant over the timescale during which the $s$ values fluctuate.
        </d-footnote> <d-cite key="castellani2005spin"></d-cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spin-glass systems are frequently found in machine learning algorithms. <d-cite key="choromanska2015loss"></d-cite><br>
        For example lets say our system searches trough a family of Hamiltonians dependent from a set of parameters $\theta$, then the Free energy will depend on theta as such
        $$
            F(\theta)=-T\log\left[\int e^{-H(\{s_i\}|\theta)/T}Ds_i\right]
        $$
        However different parameters will yield give different free energies, and since they are learned they follow a distribution $p(\theta|\mathcal D)$ dependent on the dataset $\mathcal D$. A more meaningful variable will be the expected free energy $\langle F\rangle$
        $$
            \langle F\rangle=\int F(\theta)p(\theta|\mathcal D)d\theta
        $$
        Since the loss function is the negative log likelyhood of the parameters $l(\theta|\mathcal D)=-\log p(\theta|\mathcal D)$ we can combine this with the last two equations to get
        $$
            F=-T\int e^{-l(\theta|\mathcal D)}\log\left[\int e^{-H(\{s_i\}|\theta)/T}Ds_i\right] D\theta
        $$
        This systems, more often than not, exhibit glassy behaviors, and as such, must be treated with extra care.

      But how can we make sure that our self organizing system behaves more like an Ising model, and not like a completely disorderd spin glass?<br>

        An Hopfield model with one pattern stored is mathematically equivalent to the Ising model.<br>
        As you add more and more patterns it start being more and more difficult for the system to converge to any given pattern, until it can't take it no more and it becomes glassy.

       <p>
        The statistics of this system has been extensively studied in the literature <d-cite key="mezard2017mean, amit1987statistical"></d-cite>, and it has been shown that the total number of patterns $N$ that it is possible to store  in this kind of memory is $N\approx 0.14\times P$<d-footnote>This estimate assumes that the patterns are statistically indipendent. For real life data this is usually not true as the patterns are hardly ever statistically indipendent, so it should be taken as an upper bound</d-footnote>.<br>

              Similarly to the theorems in <d-cite key="krotov2016dense,demircigil2017model"></d-cite> we are going to start the system with every spin equal to one pattern saved at random $X^q$, and then perturb perturb the system in the position $k$.<br> The difference in energy is equal to

              $$
              The reason why the first summation is only for the spins $j$ neighboring $k$ is because only Hamiltonian windows that have the spin $k$ inside them are direcly influenced by the spin flip.<br><br>
              To make the calculations easier, we are going to define the local change in energy, which by how much the Hamiltonian window centered in $j$ changes his energy when the spin $k$ is flipped.

              We can now write the total difference in energy as
              $$
                \Delta E=\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle}\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j)

              When averaging over all the possible patterns $\{X^p\}_{p\in\{1,\dots,N\}}$ the $j$ dependence goes away.<br>
            
              This means that the average energy change of the local Hamiltonian is

                  \Delta E^2=\sum_{\left \langle j_1,k  \right\rangle} \sum_{\left \langle j_2,k \right\rangle}\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_2)
              $$
              Now we calculate the average of the term inside the sum.<br>
              When we flip a bit in one window, the change in energy in the other window will be close to it. 
              $$
                  \Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_2)=\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1) + \delta
              $$
              Where $\delta$ is a random variable independent from $\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)$<d-footnote>How really accurate is this? I'm sure that if there is a dependence it is going to be small, should we consider it? and how?</d-footnote>.<br>
              Since on average the energy change of the window centered in $j_1$ is the same as the one centered in $j_2$
              $$
                  \left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)\right \rangle=\left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_2)\right \rangle
              $$
              we have that $\left \langle \delta \right \rangle=0$
              This means that
              $$
              \begin{split} 
                  \left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_2)\right \rangle=&\left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}^2(j_1)\right \rangle + \left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)\delta\right \rangle =\\
                  =&\left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}^2\right \rangle+\left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)\right \rangle\left \langle \delta\right \rangle=\\
                  =&\left \langle \Delta E^2_\textrm{loc}\right \rangle
              \end{split}
              $$
              Where from the first to the second row we have used the fact that $\delta$ is independent from $\Delta E_\textrm{loc}(j_1)$, and form the second to the third row we have used the fact that $\left \langle \delta \right \rangle =0$.<br>
              Therefore equation $\Delta E^2$ becomes
              $$
                  \left \langle \Delta E^2\right \rangle=W^2\left \langle \Delta E^2_\textrm{loc}\right \rangle
              $$
              and the variance is
              $$
                  \Sigma^2=W^2\left(\left \langle \Delta E^2_\textrm{loc}\right \rangle - \left \langle \Delta E_\textrm{loc}\right \rangle ^2\right)=W^2\Sigma_\textrm{loc}
              $$
              Suppose that the probability distribution is a Gaussian with mean $\left \langle \Delta E\right \rangle$ and variance $\Sigma^2$. Then the probability of making an error is the probability  that after the spin flips, the energy of the system decreases.
              $$
              \begin{split}
                  P=&\int_{\Delta E}^\infty\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi\Sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\Sigma^2}}dx=\\
                  =& \int_{W\Delta E_\textrm{loc}}^\infty\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi W^2\Sigma_\textrm{loc}^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2W^2\Sigma_\textrm{loc}^2}}dx=\\
                  =&\int_{\Delta E_\textrm{loc}}^\infty\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi \Sigma_\textrm{loc}^2}}e^{-\frac{z^2}{2\Sigma_\textrm{loc}^2}}dz=\\
                  =&P_\textrm{loc}
              \end{split}
              $$
              Where in the last passage we defined $z=x/W$.<br><br>
              This means that a Hopfield network with an energy function that is the sum of several overlapping sub-Hopfield networks with window size of $W$ has a storage capacity of any given sub-network

  <d-section>Some practical examples</d-section>
    <p>
      It is crucial to bear in mind that these represent some of the essential prerequisites.<br>Similar to how possessing Turing Completeness does not guarantee intelligence, having an ordered phase in a system does not automatically imply that the output will be actually coherent and meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now possess all the necessary elements to ascertain whether a system can ever exhibit the capacity to generate data coherently.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Select a topology of comunication of the cells that is equivalent to an ising model that has an ordered phase
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that the system bottlenecked by the memory capacity (either by having a large enought window size and a large enought number of trainable parameters)
          </li>
        </ol>
      Lets get so some example to show the procedure:
    </p>

    <d-subsection>Tree language model</d-subsection>
      <p>
        We want to see if a tranformer that has an attention matrix with the topology of a tree can ever generate text.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Since the ising model on the tree does have an ordered phase, the possibility of generating an infinitely long, coherent text is not constrained by the topology
          </li>
          <li>
            The bottleneck provided by the memory capacity can be widened by increasing the window size and the number of parameters
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Experiments</h4>
        <p>
          Recently a paper has come out that uses a tree-like attention structure <d-cite key="ding2023longnet"></d-cite> where the authors where able to generate text that has a linear complexity and an effective context size of 1 bilion tokens.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          However, it is unclear if this specific experiment resulted in a model that it is actually capable of retrieving any information inside that effective context of 1 bilion tokens.
        </p>

    <d-subsection>Autoregressive + Envoirnment</d-subsection>
      <p>Lets start with a system inspired on how the brain works.</p>
      <p>
        Let $B_t$ be the state of the brain at the time $t$ and $E_t$ the state of the envoirnment, we can say that the way they evolve is ruled by a set of equations like this
        $$
          \begin{cases}
          B_{t+1}=f_B[B_t,E_t]\\
          E_{t+1}=f_E[B_t,E_t]
          \end{cases}
        $$
        Note that this is simply an autoregressive model, however we can assume that the envoirnment is capable of holding on to information for longer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example when you go shopping, you write down what you have to buy in a piece of paper, this is because information stays there longer and more reliably than if you try to remember it.<br>

        This example also raises an intresting observation: When you read your shopping list, you effectively "interact" with your past self though interacting with a piece of paper. In some sense we can say that effectively $B(t_\textrm{s})=B(t_\textrm{h})$ where $t_\textrm{s}$ is when you are at the supermaket,a dn $t_\textrm{h}$ is when you are at home writing the shopping list.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we want to translate in an equivalent Ising model, we have two spin chains with different coupling constants $J_E$ and $J_B$, since the envoirnment has a much bigger coherence lenght we can assume that $J_E\gg J_B$. We also assume that there is a coupling constant $J_C$ that couples the neighboring spins of the two chains.<br>
        The Hamiltonian becomes
        $$
          H = J_E\sum_t E_tE_{t+1} + J_B\sum_t B_{t}B_{t+1}  + J_C\sum_t E_tB_{t}  
        $$
        What effectively happens, if $J_C$ is not too small, is that the coherence lenght of the brain chain becomes equal to the one of the envoirnment.

          Here is an example of the system defined in the Hamiltonian above. The $E_t$ are the spins above, while the spins below are the $B_{t}$.<br>
          For example at $T\approx 1$ if you set $J_E \approx 5$  the coherence length of the envoirnment is going to be large. You can also see that if you set the other two coupling constants relatively small $J_B, J_C\approx 1$ you are going to see that the value of the brain state $B_i$ will oscillate, but it is going to be most of the time equal to the value of the envoirnment $E_t$.<br>
          If you want to decouple the brain with the envoirnment just set $J_C=0$
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
        Lets take the Hamiltonian for our brain + envoirnment system and assume that the envoirnment has a much longer coherence lenght than the brain. We can now focus our attention inside one of the continous domains where the envoirnment is constant with a value of $E$. The Hamiltonian becomes
        $$
          H=J_b\sum_tB_tB_{t+1} + J_cE\sum_t B_t
        $$
        This is equivalent to the Hamiltonian for the 1D Ising model with an external magnetic field, since it is exactly solvable it is possible to evaluare the average value of $B=\langle B_t\rangle$

        $$
          B=\frac {\sinh (J_cE/T)}{\sqrt{\sinh^2(J_cE/T) + e^{-4J_b/T}}}
        $$
        And we have that the lower the temperature is, the more the chain aligns with the envoirnment value. 
      </p>

      <h4>Experiments</h4>
        <p>
          Systems like this made from a model with limited context lenght + an external envoirnment can be found in the language modelling + reinforcement learning literature. One that I particularly like is Vojager <d-cite key="wang2023voyager"></d-cite>, where the authors make a model that plays Minecraft
        </p>

        <p>
          In this paper the "brain" is a large language model (GPT-4), and it is able to interact with both the game world, and a code library where the LLM can both read, write and organize information
        </p>
        <p>
          By doing so the agent is capable of using skills and information that has written in the distant past. This effectively increases the context lenght of the language model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, these examples <d-cite key="ding2023longnet, wang2023voyager"></d-cite> showcase how different approaches and topologies can enhance data coherence in systems, resulting in more meaningful and contextually rich outputs.
        </p>
