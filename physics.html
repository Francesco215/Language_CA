In this work we study how self-organization and long-term cohesion can be thought as a system of particles trying reaching a ordered phase and apply it in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Biology.

<p>
The complexity of generating a text with N words with modern machine learning algorithms such as the Transformer is O(N^2). This makes it computationally infeasible to generate coherent pieces of text as long as books. Self-organizing systems, on the other hand, are systems composed of multiple agents that can spontaneously self-organize into complex structures through local interactions between the agents themselves.
</p>
<p>
A striking example of this is the formation of multicellular organisms, where each cell can only interact with its local environment through its cell membrane, but based on the signals it receives from its neighbors and its own internal state, it is able to understand what type of cell it should be and self-regulate. Despite the limited information available to each individual cell, incredibly complex organisms can be formed.

<p>
We show how the same process of self-organization that occurs in biological systems can be used to create cohesive narrative skills in linguistic space, where the words in a text self-organize to create a coherent whole.
</p>
<p>
But what makes a system capable of self-organizing in the first place? In this paper we show that the ability of a system to self-organize relies on having the right topology for cell communication. Furthermore, we show that current state of the art architectures for text generation lack the appropriate topology to be able to generate arbitrarily long, coherent text.
