    One of the things that makes phase transitions beautiful is their universality. Despite the vast variety and complexity of systems of many particles, there are just a few of different phases of aggregation, and phase transitions are described by just a handful of critical exponents.

    Furthermore, we know that at low temperature lots of systems reach an ordered state, for example the ferromagnetic phase in Ising models where all the spins are all aligned, and the solid phase in materials where a crystalline structure is formed.

    In this paper we are going to show that asking if it is possible to generate arbitrarily long, coherent text is equivalent to asking if the system is capable of having an ordered phase.

    But what makes a system capable of self-organizing in the first place? In this paper we show that the ability of a system to self-organize relies on having the right topology for cell communication. Furthermore, we show that current state of the art architectures for text generation lack the appropriate topology to be able to generate arbitrarily long, coherent text.
